  _description: The Carn Flower, a fantastical flower that grows in the heart of
    the Eldwood Forest, is renowned in all mythical realms for its extraordinary
    healing properties. This enchanted flora glows with a serene blue luminescence,
    often mistaken for the light of a full moon. Its silken petals, awash with a
    thousand shades of azure, are steeped in ancient magic. One petal, dissolved
    in crystal-clear spring water, creates a potent elixir capable of mending the
    gravest of injuries, revitalizing the weary, and dispelling the darkest curses.
    In the grand tapestry of magic, the Lumina Blossom stands as a testament to the
    gentle, restorative powers of nature.
