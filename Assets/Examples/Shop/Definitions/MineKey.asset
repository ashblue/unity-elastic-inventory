  _description: The Veinseeker Key, a symbol of authority and perseverance, is a
    legendary artifact crafted specifically for the unfathomable depths of the Crystalline
    Caverns. Forged from unyielding bedrock steel and adorned with intricate patterns
    of gem dust, this key embodies the heart and soul of generations of miners who
    have braved the labyrinthine tunnels below. Its heavy, angular structure conceals
    a magical core that reacts to the unique mineral formations within the Caverns.
    The Veinseeker Key hums gently in the presence of valuable veins, guiding miners
    through darkness and danger to hidden riches. Despite its humble appearance,
    it is the key to unlocking the earth's bountiful treasures and remains an iconic
    testament to the miners' relentless spirit.
